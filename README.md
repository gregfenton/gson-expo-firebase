# To use this code:

1. `git clone https://github.com/gregfenton/gson-expo-firebase`
2. `npm install`  (must use `npm install` since Expo isn't installed yet)
3. Edit `App.js` to put your Firebase project's config values into `firebaseConfig`
4. Run the app with `npx expo start`

If you see a Date displayed in the UI (and no errors in the expo console), then it is working!
